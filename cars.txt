1. Find all cars with the make "buick".
2. Find all cars newer than 1990.
3. Find all cars with a price between 5500 and 6500 inclusive.
4. Use grep to solve question 1.
5. Use sed to replace "honda accord" with "honda civic".
6. Use a Linux editor to add the following rows to cars.txt.

ford escort 2018 4200

chevrolet impala 2019 18700

volkswagen jetta 2016 11200

7. Use and understand all the basic file commands below. For all exercises please make use of the "man" command.
   Use the virtual linux machine in O'Reilly. 

touch file1
Create file1

cat file1 file2
Concatenate files and output

less file1
View and paginate file1

file file1
Get type of file1

cp file1 file2
Copy file1 to file2
mv file1 file2
Move file1 to file2

rm file1
Delete file1

head file1
Show first 10 lines of file1

tail file1
Show last 10 lines of file1

tail -F file1
Output last lines of file1 as it changes

8. Use and understand the file redirection commands below. Please understand stdin(0), stdout(1), stderr(2) and how to redirect.
   Check the concept of /dev/null as in redirection with 2> /dev/null or 1>&2 where & is a file descriptor.
   example: Do you see that 2> /dev/null could be placed into a shell script where you don't want the user to see any errors
   or exceptions (when they execute it) even if they are expected to occur in certain cases? Also look at cmd1 || cmd2
   where cmd2 will run if cmd 1 is not successful.
   
cmd < file
Input of cmd from file

cmd1 <(cmd2)
Output of cmd2 as file input to cmd1
cmd > file
Standard output (stdout) of cmd to file

cmd > /dev/null
Discard stdout of cmd

cmd >> file
Append stdout to file

cmd 2> file
Error output (stderr) of cmd to file

cmd 1>&2
stdout to same place as stderr

cmd 2>&1
stderr to same place as stdout

cmd &> file
Every output of cmd to file

(cmd refers to a command.)

9. Basic commands review. Reinforce your understanding of the commands below.
ls, mkdir, cd, rm, cp, whoami, which, cat, mv, pwd, echo  (list can be very large)

10. One command that can be useful to put in a boot file like .bashrc is the primary prompt below.
    This uses an environmental variable PWD which you know as pwd (present working directory). The
	variable for primary prompt is PS1 so the terminal prompt will show the directory of the system.
	PS1='${PWD}>'
	
11. Understand the quotes and $ for Linux in terms of " (double), ' (single), ` (back quote)
	a=22; echo a; echo $a; echo "$a"; echo '$a'  What do you see?
	
12. b=`echo $a`; echo $b    
    b=echo $a 2> /dev/null; ecsho $b  What is different in output here from statement 1?
